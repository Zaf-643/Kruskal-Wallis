# Reporting the main findings
A Kruskal-Wallis test was conducted to determine if there were differences in weight values between different treatment groups: the "ctrl" (n = 10), "trt1" (n = 10), and "trt2" (n = 10). Median of the weight values were statistically significantly different between the different levels of treatment, Ï‡2(2) = 14.468, p = 0.018. Subsequently, pairwise comparisons were performed using Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction. A Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons was made with statistical significance accepted at the p < 0.05 level. This post hoc analysis revealed statistically significant differences in weights between the trt1 (Mdn = 4.55) and trt2 (Mdn = 5.44) (p = 0.027).
